It was _2014_ at Bangalore. I had only recently joined **Oracle** as a `Software Developer`.  
After a month of temporary accomodation, I had found a place to stay at a PG (_Paying Guest_). Although they call it a PG, its really like a hostel.  

I got a shared room. There were 3 other people in the room, and the rent was Rs. 5000, which is a decent amount considering they also provided food.  
I used to have only dinner from the PG. I would skip breakfast mostly and have lunch from office.  

Fortunately for me, I got pretty good room mates. We used to roam around the City, talk late into the night. It was all good.  

But, **I HATED THE ROOM**.

It was a decently sized room.  
Attached bathroom.  
A window facing the South.  
4 beds. One bed beside each wall.
