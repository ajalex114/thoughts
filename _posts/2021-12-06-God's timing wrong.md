The other day, the reading during the Sunday Holy Mass was about God's messenger - Archangel Gabriel - conveying the message to Zechariah that he is going to have a child. I couldn't help myself but connect one thing from my life with Zechariah. _The Timing_.

Yes, the Timing.

I wasn't able to listen to a word the priest said during the homily as I kept pondering about one thing. Why did God have to select such a timing for Zechariah.   
Couldn't he have done it earlier?  

Then I started thinking. Isn't this a common trend in most part of the Bible?  

_But Why?_

Let me list out few that I feel are bad timing (from a human perspective), and reason as to why would God did it that way.  

For starters, I do strongly believe that God loves us all and that he wishes nothing but best for all of us. Then again, why would he put us in difficult situations? Couldn't he have selected different timings? Let's see.

## The story of Abram becoming Abraham

We all know that Abraham did not have his kid until he was 100 and Sarah was in her 90s. God, delayed for them to have a kid until they were very old. He had to do a miracle so that Sarah who was way out of the age to conceive could have a kid.  

Now, its way too easy for us to sit back and read this as a story. But, if we put ourselves in thier shoes and think.  
Imagine the kind of sorrow that they would have gone through.  
The uncertainty.  
The society looking at them with pity. And this goes for long years.  

And then one day God shows up to them and says you are not Abram anymore but Abraham.  
If it were me, I would have told this to God:  
_"Yeah.. funny that. Lord, stop mocking me. I am getting enough from the people around. You are the last person I expect it from"._  
Basically a _'you too Brutus'_ moment to God.  
But Abram just believed God's words and trusted him to keep his word, against all odds.

To understand the context, you will have to look at the meanings of the two names.  
Abram means **Exhaulted Father**  
Abraham means **Father of Multitudes** or **Father of Nations**  

But back to the question. Why did God have to chose this timing?  
He could have given them a kid in their 20s or their 30s or max in their 40s.  
Why did he chose this timing?  

>Well, if he had, we probably wouldn't have known the name Abraham. We certainly wouldn't have called Abraham as the _Father of Faith_.  
God repayed for the sacrifice Abraham had to make for God's decision to delay the timing.  
He gave him _honor_, _respect_, made him Father to Nations which when you look at it is no small feat.  
You look at Israel, you know the country's Father: Abraham.  
Which other country's father do you know (the biological father)?  
None.  

There is no other country on this entire planet where you could trace it back to a single father.  
That is God's price to Abraham.

## The Israelites as slaves  

The israelites were slaves to Egyptians for roughly 430 years.  
Now God comes to Moses and says, **"I have heard them cry out to be rescued from their slave drivers"**.  
Was he deaf for all those years? Why did he wait?  

As it turnes out, there is a pretty valid reason for that.  
Apparently, the Israelites had been well off at Egypt for a very long time and their body had become too fragile.  
God had to prepare them to be a Nation. Not just some random nation, but a strong nation who knew and trusted their God.  
But with this kind of body? It was impossible.  
So he wanted them to be fit. The slavery helped.  
Now after roughly 430 years, the fitness of their body become part of their genes (_I'm not good at biology, but you get the idea_).

Now, God knew it was time. The right time for phase 2.  
If phase 1 was to make them fit, phase 2 was to show them the power of God.  
You know the rest of the story.  
That travel through the wilderness was not just about reaching the promised land, but also about defining Israel as a country.  

>If God hadn't chosen this timing, we probably wouldn't  know of the country Israel. It probably wouldn't have survived for long.  
But instead even today, Israel being such a small country surrounded by enemy nations stand upright, undestructable.  
One of the most powerful militaries in the world.  
One of the most influential countries in the world.  

How come? _God's wrong timing_ or should I say _God's perfect timing_.

## The messenger's news to Mother Mary

The timing to Abraham was harmless, the timing to Israel was for a society, not particularly personal or personal.  
But, here comes Mother Mary.  

She hasn't done anything wrong.  
She is Engaged to Joseph.  
She is very prayful.  
She loves God to the fullest.  
She trusts God to the extreme.  

What does God give her? A bad timing.  
Of course, reading it as a story, we don't feel so.

But what would I think if I was in her place?  
I would have said,  
**"**  
_Lord, couldn't you have waited a few more weeks? I would be married by then._  
_Now, people will call me adulterer._  
_They would stone me to death (as per the law of Moses)._  
_Joseph, my fiance will leave me._  
_People will look down on me._  
_I will be ashamed._  
_My family will look at me with disgust._  
_All the image that I have had or built till now, all destroyed._  
_How will I handle all this?_  
_How will I survive all this?_  
_It feels like its better to give up on this chance to be God's mother than to go through this._  
**"**

That's a huge list!  

But what did Mother Mary say?  
**"Be it done to me according to thy word"**

What was the outcome?  

Well, as we all know,  
>God kept Mother Mary out of danger.  
He took deep care of Mother Mary.  
He made her the Mother to all.  
He exhaulted Mother Mary above all.  
He made her the Queen of Heaven and Earth.

To add on, if it weren't for this timing, Jesus would not have Joseph as Father. Cos, of course, why would someone marry a pregnant woman.  
Also, Mother Mary would have been stoned to death for sure, if Joseph had not taken her up as his wife.  

Well, I have to admit, 
>There was no better time for God to make this happen in Mother Mary's life.  

## Back to Zechariah

I believe you get the pattern by now. God didn't do this to Zechariah in his 20s or 30s so that he could put Zechariah on the map.  
>If John the baptist was born at an earlier time, we wouldn't have know Zechariah at all.  
Also, by the nature of John the baptist, he would probably be long dead by the time Jesus started his public ministry.  
Both of their timings HAD to coincide.  

>To speak the least, God planned it all perfectly. We are the ones who failed to see it.  

## The Great Plan

God, unlike us sees the bigger picture.  
He doesn't live just in the present. He lives in the past, present and the future.  
He doesn't see just Me and You. He sees all possible connections that I could possibly have and all the timings that have to happen to all those connections for things to come together beautifully.  
Now, if you expand the above sentence further, all connections have other connections and they have other connections. It goes to infinity.  
So, basically when God plans his timings, he defines it for the entire world at one go.  

Yes, there are much more than just timings. Timing is just one dimension of the big picture. There is free will, there are after effects of our actions, there are a lot of aspects God walks through when he acts on Me and You.  
I am but limiting this article to just timing, which in itself is a great topic.  

## Conslusion

I guess the short summary is God acts on us, at timings which we might feel uncomfortable, but is perfect from God's perspective, in the best of our interests.  
God also utilizes these timings to teach us to trust in him blindly.  

It is upto us to decide if we should follow the _Zechariah approach_ or the _Mother Mary approach_.  
>Do I doubt his timings given the situation, like Zechariah?  
OR  
Do I act like Mother Mary who stayed calm and trusted God blindly in her situation?  

Personally, I feel that I resemble more closely to Zechariah.  

I am currently going through a bunch of such timings.  
They look totally wrong to me. I fail to see how or why God decided to act up on things at such timings.  
I fail to stay calm.  
But then again, I have to remind myself _I am not God_. I don't see the big picture.  
But, _I should trust God to do the right thing_. He knows best. He sees the big picture.  

He will do the right thing at the right time.  
To him, all that happened was at the perfect timing.  
I just have to learn to trust him.  

**God's timing. Its the perfect timing.**
