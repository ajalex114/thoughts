I have been seeing few videos on the topic of Sufferings of human kind and God in it.  
It just made me think about my sufferings and how I deal with God on it.

Well, simple answer. `Not well`.

I know of Saints who have asked for sufferings from God.  
I am not that guy.  
I am the kind of person who doesn't want any sufferings. But, everyone knows that it is far from the truth.  
There is no escaping from sufferings in life.  
The alternative? `Deal with it`.  
> When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.

I've had difficult times in my life. Many of them. Still have.  
When they come, I deal with it pretty poorly with God, I guess.

I go to him and start shouting, screaming, crying. I even rebel to him.

I say things like

> _Why are you unfair to me?  
> What did I do to deserve this?  
> How could you do this to me?  
> How can you be so cruel?  
> You just don't care about me, don't you?  
> I'm just tired, please relieve me of this pain.._

But almost always I end with this: _"But I still Love You"_.  
Its not me, its God's grace that has always helped me say it.  
I know itâ€™s a lot to live up to.  
I'm not sure if I'll be able to keep saying this forever. _Even Peter failed. Who am I then?_  

Every time something comes up, I tell God that "enough is enough. Please don't give me anything anymore."  
But then again, he doesn't listen. I wish he does.

Truth is, most of the times I don't find comfort, until it goes by, if it goes by.  
But there is one thing I know.

God is by my side. He is holding my hands strong and firm.  
Cos, __He loves me__.

And That, is THE one thing that has held me up and running through my sufferings.

And I know this one more thing.  
__God Loves You__.

God Bless.
