# My thoughts and reflections

This repository is about creating and publishing a blog filled with my thoughts at https://thoughts.ajalex.com

The write-ups are merely a reflection of my thoughts, ideologies, learnings and life experiences. No one else can be held accountable for any of it.

### _Side Note_
Credits to the jekyll theme Flexton which is an ultra-minimalist and responsive theme.

You can find the theme in action at: [Demo](https://flexton.netlify.com/)
